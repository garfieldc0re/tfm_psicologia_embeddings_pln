• When new information threatens identity and meaning, the mind often responds by tuning out.

Over the last 20 years, new science has shown more connections and cemented learning and fun together.

Now, I get a lot of my beliefs from ndes- the good ones are usually very open to all beliefs, mostly because they’ll do a good job reminding everyone ‘the afterlife may just look different for everyone’ and because we can’t know Everything about it (even if you had an extraordinary nde) then everything is still unfalsifiable.

Buddhism;1pozbn2;Remaining neutral or at center with difficult peers.;"I have been practicing meditation thoroughly since I was 29 (so about 6 years now). I still find it difficult to navigate some personalities. 

A key example being a coworker that simply will not admit when he has made a mistake, corners anyone he sees to overshare excessively personal topics in the workplace and treats people of a similar job title as if he is the only one who can fix the issue, eluding with his tone and mannerisms that they are inept. This would not be so troublesome if he didn't then turn to the same persons he confides and overshares to with the most bumptious attitude and makes claims like ""I'm not one of the boss's favorites."" I should mention this man is in psychotherapy and is very unapproachable. How do I navigate around this man to keep my peace. I have found that I cannot assist in his growth without being provoked and i cannot lose my job.

I am in a really rough period at the moment. My therapist suggested going to a psychiatrist to understand if combining therapy with medication could be more useful for me. I am open to the idea.

fictionalpsychology;1pg5q0p;What about Bob?;I am writing my masters thesis on film perceptions of mental health. I really want to include the movie, “What about Bob” starring Bill Murray. I’m having trouble nailing down the diagnosis. A part of me believes he may have a standard set of diagnoses like OCD, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite this, his progression to ultimately showing no symptoms by the end of the movie leads me to believe a majority of his symptoms were a form of manipulation. I really do believe that he would be considered an individual with antisocial personality disorder, or something along those lines. I talked to a couple of my friends that are in clinical psyc masters / doctorate programs and they’re stumped as well. Ill have to go through and defend my DSM-5 diagnosis. If anyone who has seen the movie has any insight or believes they know the diagnosis please help!

I’m a social worker providing counselling in a health care setting. I have a diagnosis of ADHD. While I “present” as neurotypical, I am anything but. I am very high masking but as I age this has become more and more challenging. I experienced severe burnout last year and it took quite a while to recover, and my ability to mask (especially in work settings) has gotten a lot more difficult. Overall, ADHD has had a very significant impact on my life, my relationships, my daily functioning, my sense of self, and my mental health. I take it seriously because I know it is serious. But, because I am perceived as neurotypical I’m not often taken seriously.

I’m new at my workplace and I have a supervisor who is overall lovely. They are experienced in the field and particularly counselling, they are patient, kind, and helpful.

Growing up, I had a very unstable upbringing, and I was on and off meds for depression and anxiety (and at one point for bipolar disorder) for years. 

For context, the only recognizable and isolatable symptom of ADHD I remember having back then is *constantly* having to replace my library card due to losing it (which was pretty odd considering the library & books were my solace). 

I eventually grew up, got away from my parents, and most of my ""depressive"" symptoms went away. I struggled with job hopping and a lack of motivation, but overall I was doing okay. 

Eventually I met my husband and we had kids. My symptoms kind of migrated into struggling with daily chores, a big one being cleaning. I would start cleaning, make a trash pile, then burn out. Start again, make a new trash pile, burn out. Again. I would get so exhausted and bogged down, and no amount of caffeine helped.
