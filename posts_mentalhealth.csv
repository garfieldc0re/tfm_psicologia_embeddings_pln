But all the doors are closing around me and genuinely there is no human being who wants to care or support me in my real life . My family has so many issues that it's taking a huge toll on my mental health ( there is no way for me to live alone btw) I have friends who moved abroad to study and just moved on with their lives , I am stuck in a life I never wanted , trying to hold myself together, but I have finally hit my limit. There is nothing in me that wants to go on , nothing but emptiness and numbness.

I stopped expecting things from people , but that doesn't mean I can survive on a 0% battery, you can't do anything without giving yet when you give  you still get nothing.
