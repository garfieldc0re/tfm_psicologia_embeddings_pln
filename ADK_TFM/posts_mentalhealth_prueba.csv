Trembles, high sensitivity to light and noises, insomnia, gut went hell, nausea like it would k!ll me by vomiting, panic attacks one after another, derealization-depersonalization, what wasn't there; and I was all alone abroad, so afraid that I didn't let anybody know, with zero support network. Thinking about it makes me tear up. I never knew it could all be anxiety.

mentalhealth,1pn0knd,Nothing can be built on a weak foundation,"People often note that poverty makes long-term financial planning difficult.

The same limitation existed for pre-agricultural Sapien tribes, whose survival demands narrowed their planning horizon.

At a deeper level, this reflects present value calculations applied across human needs, not just economic ones.

mentalhealth,1pmw426,"I'm still haunted by what my ex friend and ex boyfriend did to me ; Going to EMDR and therapy but it's still stays with me, how do I stop it, I want better mental health.","Today was really shitty for me because from some reason I had a flashback about what my ex friend and ex boyfriend did to me , it's been affecting me for the past few days. They use to compare me to my bullies; especially one in particular and say I was average compared to her and that she was pretty due to her light complexion and eyes , they kept repeating this until I felt a sense of inferiority (my boyfriend kept going on and on about how she found me ugly and I was the prettiest). My boyfriend knew she was my bully and after he broke up with me he slept with her (both to spite me) and then wanted me to support him during his divorce on the woman he cheated on me with , to add he was also apart of a group chat of people who bullied me horribly and relayed messages to me that the bullies told him. I don't speak to him anymore and realized what a loser we was. My friend also did this , told me how sad it would look for me to go back to nursing school at my age , blackmailed me /doxxe...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pmw426/im_still_haunted_by_what_my_ex_friend_and_ex/,2,0,2025-12-15T02:29:29Z
mentalhealth,1pmvmrr,Don’t know how to maintain mental health when super busy,"I’m a student who’s studying in a major that requires a huge amount of workload, while also working on part time alongside. 
I do think it’s possible to do all the work, I do keep my part time at 10hrs and I know what i’m doing would get me closer to my dream.
I don’t really feel very depressed/ burn out in fact, but my body does get affected by stress , often when I’m super busy I’d get sick and just today I’m vomiting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pmvmrr/dont_know_how_to_maintain_mental_health_when/,1,2,2025-12-15T02:06:18Z
mentalhealth,1pmvl97,I don't know what to do anymore,"TW: S*icidal thoughts and tendencies and implications of Self-H

I'm tired of everything. At this point, there's not a day where I'm not crying. My mental health has only gotten worse. College is draining me. And it's the end of the semester, I'm failing 2 classes. My schedule had 2 in person classes, and 2 online classes. Obviously, the in person classes are my best grades. I don't even look on my dashboard because I'm scared of my grade.

Grades are going to be put in on Tuesday, and I'm too tired to try and raise them. But if my mom knows I'm failing a class, she'll get mad at me. I spent almost all night hunched on my knees over my bed, crying. Even when I think I've calmed down, I just end up crying again. I've thought about s*icide numerous times, for years in fact.

I've tried acting out on it as well, and instead of getting support, I'm ignored or get yelled at. I want to drop out of college, but I know I won't hear the end of it. I know I can raise my grades in two days, I've ...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pmvl97/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,1,1,2025-12-15T02:04:23Z
mentalhealth,1pmve0i,"""ruining"" a lovely snow day","TLDR: this morning was full of whimsy and holiday spirit, but when I crashed out due to an uncompleted to-do list, an impromptu family gathering quickly goes sour. (With a side of mother/employer-child/employee drama)

...

This morning was wonderful! There was a beautiful, thin layer of powdery snow on the ground, my family was sending all of our snowy window pictures in the family group chat. Lots of exclamation marks and smiley emojis were sent.

Then my mom invited me over to decorate the Christmas tree. Had this not been sent after I wrote out my to-do list for the day, I would have been a happy camper. But alas, my to-do list was already written, and although I knew this would mean I wouldn't do everything I wanted to do, I grudgingly said yes.

Fast forward a few hours, I finally realize I'm feeling grumpy about coming over! In an effort to better communicate, I ask to reschedule, and everyone can make it! I'm thrilled that I was able to set boundaries and come up with a comprom...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pmve0i/ruining_a_lovely_snow_day/,1,0,2025-12-15T01:54:55Z
