This messed me up quite a bit and I was in and out of therapy and support groups for years over this. The support group is where I met my current partner (45M), he is a widower who lost his wife to cancer and we understood each others pain a lot and bonded over it. Three years ago we started dating and we moved in with each other last month.

I've remained close with the family of my late fiancé since I lost him and they were a great support to me in the first few years. However, his Mother (61F) asked me last week for the ring he gave me back since i'm now seriously involved with another man. She said she wanted the ring to keep in the family and it'd mean a lot to have it.
