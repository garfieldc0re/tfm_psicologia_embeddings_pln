mentalhealth,1pn55ay,Can I ever be cured..?,"Hi people on Reddit. I don’t normally make posts but I was hoping to find people that have been through what’s happened to me that can hopefully help. 

Okay to start off.. I’m a high schooler and have been struggling with my mental health for around 4-5 years now. 

My biggest issue is my motivation. I have constantly have no motivation to wake up in the mornings so my parents have to wake me up so I can get to school. I have no motivation to eat so sometimes I starve myself even though my stomach hurts. Also please don’t judge for this next one but I have no motivation to take care of myself (hygiene). Lastly I have no motivation to do anything that I love (my hobbies, going after my passions, talking to my friends). 


The thing is too is that I’ve tried to help myself constantly through the years! I have hope. I have goals. Yet I never physically do anything to get to them. I consistently tell myself in my head to get up and do something yet I never listen. I hate to believe that I...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pn55ay/can_i_ever_be_cured/,1,1,2025-12-15T11:32:27Z
mentalhealth,1pn4zyh,I completed my therapy,"A year ago, I was diagnosed with having Borderline Personality Traits which had begun to affect my relationships, especially my marriage. Deep anxiety with constant panic attacks had become a norm for last 2 years. I was also moderately depressed. 
The BPT diagnosis felt unreal at that time. Then I tried to get myself more educated and informed. My therapist made both me and my husband realise that things can get worse between us because he had been picking up my emotional baggage for the last 7 years and there will come a time when he would be exhausted. 
The therapy helped me regulate my own emotions and showed me a way to be more independent. 

I still have a long way to go but now I am more content, not depressed, not constantly anxious and my husband no longer needs to walk on eggshells around me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pn4zyh/i_completed_my_therapy/,1,0,2025-12-15T11:23:38Z

mentalhealth,1pn3r1s,How can social media influencers contribute positively to mental health awareness?,"Social media influencers can help mental health a lot when they use their platforms with heart, honesty, and responsibility. They can turn “scrolling” into support instead of pressure or shame.​

**Share real stories, not fake perfection**

When influencers talk openly about their own anxiety, burnout, therapy, or bad days, it makes followers feel less alone and more normal. This kind of honest storytelling reduces shame and encourages people to ask for help.​

**Educate without pretending to be a therapist**

Influencers can share basic information, coping tips, and where to find real help (helplines, therapists, trusted sites), while clearly saying, “This is my experience, not medical advice.” Studies suggest that clear disclaimers and signposting to services make content safer and more useful.​

**Use their reach for campaigns and resources**

They can join or lead mental health campaigns, promote crisis lines, support days like World Mental Health Day, and partner with ethical bran...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pn3r1s/how_can_social_media_influencers_contribute/,2,0,2025-12-15T10:03:24Z

I used to try, but his illness became my responsibility to fix, and that was obviously not healthy.

A few months ago, right in the middle of my PhD, after having a brief but horrible mental breakdown, I literally collapsed into an anxiety disorder (though I didn't know what it was then). Trembles, high sensitivity to light and noises, insomnia, gut went hell, nausea like it would k!ll me by vomiting, panic attacks one after another, derealization-depersonalization, what wasn't there; and I was all alone abroad, so afraid that I didn't let anybody know, with zero support network. Thinking about it makes me tear up. I never knew it could all be anxiety.

mentalhealth,1pn0knd,Nothing can be built on a weak foundation,"People often note that poverty makes long-term financial planning difficult.

The same limitation existed for pre-agricultural Sapien tribes, whose survival demands narrowed their planning horizon.

At a deeper level, this reflects present value calculations applied across human needs, not just economic ones.

mentalhealth,1pmx7u6,I just need to vent and have someone listen.,"Today was a really bad day, and I have no one to talk to about it, so I'm just going to put it down here and hope for the best.

I've been in a pretty bad mental state for a few years, tried therapy, but I just don't think it's the right therapist for me. I stopped seeing her because things weren't getting better with myself, and I stopped seeing a point in trying. I am unable to get a new therapist currently.

Everyday feels like I'm just here existing, like I give no value to anything in the world. Today was especially bad. I was home alone, so I just walked around the house for 2 hours, crying. I didn't know what to do, I just felt disgusted with myself. I hate everything about me, and I felt so ashamed. As I'm writing this now, nothing has changed. The only difference was that this time, I got really close to just giving up. I remember holding onto a bottle of Tylenol for a good 5 minutes just sobbing before putting it back.

Everything just hurts, and I'm so tired. I don't know wh...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pmx7u6/i_just_need_to_vent_and_have_someone_listen/,1,5,2025-12-15T03:24:50Z
mentalhealth,1pmwzk2,I just really want to disappear,Like the title says I really want to just disappear. I have been suicidal most of my life but the last few years I have been working really hard on my mental health and myself. Im on medication. Im trying ti see the positive side. I have been doing well. However im still struggling but now I just kinda want to disappear run away from it all. My partner is constantly upset with me. I do everything wrong no matter how hard I try. I have a hormone disorder that constantly makes me feel like shit all the time. Im already spinning in my head with negative thoughts about myself. On top of the constant worry of infertility and getting older and no where closer to the family I want. I work 11+ hour days typically with no lunch. I use to care for the house and dinners but I haven't been doing that a lot recently.  I dont have the time i leave for work before 8 im not home until after im tired.

mentalhealth,1pmwrpp,"Men's Support Group - Grief, Loss, Loneliness","Pardon if I overstep.  I lost my wife of 43 years in early 2014.  I attended 5 bereavement groups in the first 3 months. Some I found were not very helpful with most of the session covering the basics for this weeks newcomer. One, led by a school teacher was good, because she had a ""lesson plan"":. But it was roughly just  6 weeks and it was over. 

  
 Things changed dramatically when I found a men's support group. The group, a peer-led , secular, non-profit group founded by a prominent psychologist specializing on men's issues. It was at that time some 26 years old and had 6 groups, three locations within a 40 mile parameter, each meeting every two weeks and facilitated by men from the groups. The framework processes and rules, lead men to be compassionate and empathetic.  (It's called [**Men Mentoring Men** ](https://menmentoringmen.org/)aka M3 and now meets both face-to face and via Zoom online - ( [mthrree.org](http://mthrree.org) )

  
  The first meeting it was clear that my expr...",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pmwrpp/mens_support_group_grief_loss_loneliness/,2,1,2025-12-15T03:01:39Z
